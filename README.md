#Get started with Azure Data Catalog

This sample shows you how to use the Azure Data Catalog REST API to Register, Search, and Delete data assets.

To get started using this sample, you first need to build the executable, following the steps below:

1. Download the sample project
2. Open the sample project in Visual Studio and install the latest version of the dependent NuGet packages (e.g Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory) 
3. Create (or use an existing) Azure Active Directory Application ID and corresponding information. If you do not have one and need instructions on how to get one, you can check [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/datacatalog/register-a-client-app) 
4. Compile the app.
5. You are now ready to run it.
